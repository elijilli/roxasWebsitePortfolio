          Hi! I am Irish B. Roxas, a 4th-year Computer Engineering Student in 
          Technological Institute of the Philippines - Manila. When I am not studying, 
          you'll find me tucked away in a quiet, dim corner, lost between the pages 
          of a book. Cliche as may sound but I believe that  a small stumbles are some gentle nudges toward something better. ðŸŽ€
